                        I'm a Computer Engineering student pursuing my B.S. at Georgia Tech, graduating in May 2027. 
                        My passion lies in <strong>system architecture</strong> and <strong>distributed systems</strong>, 
                        where I explore how complex systems are designed, built, and scaled to handle real-world challenges.

                    <p class="description">
                        I'm fascinated by the intricate balance between performance, scalability, and reliability in 
                        distributed computing environments. Through my coursework and projects, I'm developing expertise 
                        in building robust systems that can efficiently process, analyze, and distribute data across 
                        multiple nodes while maintaining consistency and fault tolerance.
